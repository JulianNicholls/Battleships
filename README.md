# Battleships

Battleships - the classic pen-and-paper game.

## Text Version

There is a text version that fills in the computer grid and allows the player
to attack it.

## Graphic version using Gosu / gosu_enhanced_

The Gosu graphic version first allows the user to place their ships and
swap their orientation. After the player's ships have been placed, turns
are taken by the user and computer to attack each other.

Gameplay is self-explanatory, assisted by the on-screen help.

### Pretty Font

There is an option to use freeware font 'Good Times' from Typodermic Fonts, Inc.
It can be downloaded [here](http://www.1001fonts.com/sans-serif-fonts.html)
and put into the media directory. Otherwise, the Gosu default font is used.

# Installation

    bundle

or
