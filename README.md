# Battleships

Battleships, initially text, eventually player against computer using Gosu.

So far, there is a basic one-sided game in both text mode and using Gosu. The 
player can attack but the computer is not trying to yet.

There is an option to use freeware font Good Times from Typodermic Fonts, Inc. 
It can be downloaded [here](http://www.1001fonts.com/sans-serif-fonts.html). 
Otherwise, the Gosu default font is used.
