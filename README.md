Battleships
===========

Battleships, initially text, eventually player against computer using Gosu.

So far, there is a basic one-sided game in that the user can attack but the 
computer is not trying to yet.

There is an option to use freeware font Good Times from Typodermic Fonts, Inc. 
It can be downloaded [here](http://www.1001fonts.com/sans-serif-fonts.html). 
Otherwise, the Gosu default font is used.
